## General description

Canopy height quantifies the average stand height of trees within each pixel. Because this is a spatial average
over a moderate resolution, the modeled height values are shorter than the tallest individual tree within a pixel.

The data layer has four bands:

- **Canopy Height** quantifies the average height of all vegetation in that pixel.
- **Lower prediction bound (5th percentile)** of the 90% prediction interval for model predictions at each pixel.
- **Upper prediction bound (95th percentile)** of the 90% prediction interval for model predictions at each pixel.
